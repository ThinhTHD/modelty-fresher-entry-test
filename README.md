## Problem 1: Custom FizzBuzz

### Description
Print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of a given number `x`, print "Foo" instead of the number, and for multiples of another given number `y`, print "Bar". For numbers which are multiples of both `x` and `y`, print "FooBar".

### Assumptions
- The values of `x` and `y` are provided within the main method.

### Instructions to Run
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac CustomFizzBuzz.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java CustomFizzBuzz
   ```
## Problem 2: Advanced Palindrome Check

### Description
Check whether a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. The function should handle Unicode characters properly.

### Assumptions
- The input string is provided within the main method.

### Instructions to Run
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac AdvancedPalindromeCheck.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java AdvancedPalindromeCheck
   ```
## Problem 3: Anagram Groups

### Description
Group a list of strings into anagrams. Each group should contain the strings that are anagrams of each other.

### Assumptions
- The input list of strings is provided within the main method.

### Instructions to Run
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac AnagramGroups.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java AnagramGroups
   ```
## Problem 4: Sparse Array Rotation

### Description
Rotate a sparse array (an array with a significant number of default values, such as `null`) to the right by a given number of steps, ensuring the default values are preserved in their relative positions.

### Assumptions
- The input array and the number of steps are provided within the main method.
 ## Problem 5: Dynamic HTML Page
### Description
Create a simple HTML page with a form that includes:
A text input for the user's name
A number input for the user's age
A dropdown for selecting the user's favorite color (with at least three options)
A submit button
When the form is submitted, display the inputted values on the same page without refreshing. Additionally, change the background color of the page to the selected favorite color.
### Assumptions
The form submission is handled using JavaScript without any server-side processing.

### Instructions to Run
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac SparseArrayRotation.java
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java SparseArrayRotation
   ```
Each problem's solution is encapsulated within its own Java class, and the main method demonstrates how to use the provided functions.
```
3.Run the HTML file:
```Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the form in action.```
